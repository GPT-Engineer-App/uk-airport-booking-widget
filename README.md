# uk-airport-booking-widget

I need a comprehensive booking widget to book major UK airports, it should be displayed well and it must also have an admin section where i can list the prices. i need the user to pick the date and time of the pickup time required and the flight number, i need the quantity of passengers and the quantity of bags, plus a small area where the user can send a note. it should email to hello@blackpoolcabs.com once the form has been filled in. make it look nice and use small icons for sections on the form. the company is called Blackpool Cabs LTD
